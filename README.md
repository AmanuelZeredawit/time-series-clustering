# ML_Project (SPINEWISE)

Multivariant Time Series clustering

Built a model to cluster human movements detected by spinewise sensors weared behind neck (measurements_n) and on the belt (measuremnets_r)

Analyzed multiple measurements data of a device. Created clustering models to label human movements during working; the device record 25 readings per second.Considiring 

7 features wich accelerator X, Y, Z and gyroscope X,Y, Z and the difference between alpha and beta angels.


# Clustering Models used-

filter

Symbolic Aggression

principle component analysis

ruptures segmentation (sliding_windows)

K_means algorithm

DBSCAN algorithm



# Skills and Tools

Exploratory Data Analysis on Time Series Data, filter Smoothing Models, PCA, SAX, K_means Models, ruptures Models

# Results

defining 5 classes of workers movements and define them depending on labeled data haded from the company (wandelen, buiging, staan, armen_hoog, kalibratie)
